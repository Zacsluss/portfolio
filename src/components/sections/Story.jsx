              I didn't start out wanting to govern $5M+ CRM platforms. I started out fascinated by how systems could solve real human problems. Early in my career at EVO Payments, I watched underwriting teams drown in manual processes â€” and I saw an opportunity. By integrating SQL-based scoring models with our core systems, we cut turnaround time by 60%. Watching that team go home earlier, less stressed? That's when I knew.

              Today I operate at Fortune 500 scale, but that same drive remains: <strong>automate the tedious, elevate the human</strong>. Whether it's unifying 3,000+ users across 22 countries or building particle systems at 60 FPS, I approach every challenge the same way â€” with curiosity, precision, and a relentless focus on making complex things feel simple.

              Outside work, I'm flying drones to capture 360Â° aerial photography, producing music, creating digital art, or experimenting with AI/ML projects. Why? Because <strong>curiosity makes better strategists</strong>. The best enterprise architects don't just understand technology â€” they understand creativity, user experience, and the art of making data tell stories.

              I'm seeking <strong>Director/VP roles</strong> in Enterprise Platforms, Global CRM Strategy, or Digital Transformation Leadership â€” where I can architect transformation strategies at scale, lead cross-functional teams through complex change, and prove that the best technology leaders never stop creating.
