const e={personal:{title:"Lead CRM Systems Analyst",bio:"I design and govern the digital ecosystems that keep global enterprises running—spanning Salesforce, ERP, and data clouds across 20+ countries and $10M+ in technology investments. I turn complexity into clarity, automation into scale, and platforms into measurable growth—often improving productivity by 40% or more.\n\nBy day, I architect multi-cloud systems and negotiate million-dollar vendor contracts; by night, I build particle simulations at 60 FPS and pilot drones through physics-defying spaces. Whether it's enterprise architecture or visual experiments, my work always comes down to the same thing: precision, performance, and a curiosity that never switches off.",location:"New Hampshire, USA (Remote)",email:"zacharyjsluss@gmail.com",phone:"(603) 515-6051"},experience:[{id:"exp-1",company:"Computershare",position:"Lead CRM Systems Analyst",startDate:"2023-07",description:"Lead enterprise CRM strategy and digital transformation initiatives for thousands of global users across over 20 countries.
