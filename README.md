## 🎮 What Is This?

An **interactive 3D portfolio** built with React and WebGL that's equal parts resume and tech showcase. Type your name in the input box and watch **30,000 particles** morph to spell it out. Drag to rotate the view. Try the Konami code. Have fun!

**Tech Stack:**
```
React 19 • Three.js • WebGL 2.0 • Custom GLSL Shaders
```

**The Numbers:**
- 🌟 **30,000 particles** running at 60 FPS on desktop
- ⚡ **10,000 particles** on mobile (adaptive rendering)
- 📦 **~295KB gzipped** total bundle size
- 🎯 **5.4 second** production build time
- 🎨 **Custom shaders** written in GLSL
- 🚀 **Zero dependencies** for particle rendering (pure WebGL)

## 🚀 Run It Yourself

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Zacsluss/portfolio.git
cd portfolio/particle-portfolio

# Install dependencies (takes ~30 seconds)
npm install

# Start dev server (opens at localhost:3000/portfolio/)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

**That's it!** Swap out my info in `src/data/portfolio-data.js` and it's yours.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Three reasons:

1. **To learn** - Pushed myself to master WebGL, shader programming, and GPU optimization
2. **To impress** - Show employers I can build things that are both functional AND memorable
3. **To share** - Give back to the community with a fully open-source, production-ready template

This portfolio proves I can:
- ✅ Write performant, production-quality code
- ✅ Master complex technologies (WebGL, GLSL, React internals)
- ✅ Optimize ruthlessly (60 FPS with 30K particles!)
- ✅ Care about UX (works beautifully on mobile)
- ✅ Ship real projects (you're looking at it!)

## 🎨 What Makes This Special

### 🌟 The Particle System
- **GPU-accelerated** with custom GLSL shaders
- **Real-time physics** - particles react to your mouse
- **Morphing animations** - smooth transitions between text states
- **Adaptive rendering** - automatically scales down on mobile

### 💎 Production Quality
- **Optimized bundle** - Smart code splitting (React, Three.js, R3F in separate chunks)
- **Lazy loading** - All sections load on-demand
- **Gzip compression** - 70% smaller files
- **Clean code** - ESLint configured, zero unused dependencies
- **Fast builds** - 5.4 seconds from code to production

### 🎯 Developer Experience
- **Hot Module Reload** - See changes instantly
- **TypeScript ready** - Easy to add if you want it
- **Documented** - Comments where they matter
- **Extensible** - Add your own sections easily

---

## 📦 What's Included

- ✅ Complete portfolio with 6 sections (About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Additional Work, Contact)
- ✅ 30,000-particle interactive 3D name morphing
- ✅ Starfield background with depth of field
- ✅ Custom WebGL cursor
- ✅ Konami code easter egg
- ✅ Fully responsive (desktop → mobile)
- ✅ Production-ready build configuration
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment script
- ✅ All my personal data as a template

## 🤝 Use This For Your Own Portfolio!

**I built this to be shared.** Here's how to make it yours:

1. **Fork this repo** (or download the ZIP)
2. **Edit `src/data/portfolio-data.js`** - Replace my info with yours
3. **Swap images** in `public/portfolio-images/`
4. **Update `index.html`** meta tags for SEO
5. **Deploy** with `npm run deploy`

That's literally it. **No credit required** (but appreciated!).

**Star this repo if it helps you!** ⭐

## 📄 License

**MIT License** - Do whatever you want with this! Use it for your portfolio, learn from it, remix it, sell it (I guess?). Just don't blame me if your particles revolt.

**One request:** Don't copy it verbatim with my name still on it. That would be... awkward. 😅
