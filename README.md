## 🎯 Why This Matters

I don't just write code—I architect solutions. This portfolio is a statement: **30,000 GPU-accelerated particles at 60 FPS** running in your browser with zero dependencies on external compute. It's what happens when you combine technical depth with product vision.

### The Technical Flex 💪

```
React 18 + Three.js + Custom GLSL Shaders
├─ 60 FPS with 30k particles (desktop) | 30 FPS with 10k (mobile)
├─ Adaptive performance based on hardware detection
├─ Custom particle physics with mouse interaction
├─ Real-time morphing between states with GSAP
└─ Glassmorphism UI with custom WebGL cursor
```

**Translation**: I build things that scale, perform, and delight users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Philosophy

I choose tools that solve problems, not resume keywords.

| What | Why |
|------|-----|
| **React Three Fiber** | Declarative 3D—productivity meets performance |
| **WebGL 2.0 + GLSL** | When you need the GPU, not the CPU |
| **Vite** | Because webpack config is a time sink |
| **GSAP** | Industry-standard animation—smooth is fast |
| **Zustand** | State management without the boilerplate |

## 🧠 CTO Mindset

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component-driven design** for scalability and maintainability
- **Performance budgets** enforced via hardware detection
- **Progressive enhancement** for mobile devices
- **Zero-config deployment** with GitHub Actions

### What I Bring to Leadership
✅ **Technical Vision** — I see the product 3 versions ahead
✅ **Scalability First** — Built for growth, not just launch
✅ **Developer Experience** — Fast CI/CD, clear docs, happy teams
✅ **Performance Culture** — 60 FPS isn't luck, it's engineering
