## 💡 What This Is

A portfolio that runs **30,000 GPU-accelerated particles at 60 FPS** in your browser. No external compute, no compromises on mobile. It's what happens when you treat performance as a feature, not an afterthought.

```
React 18 + Three.js + Custom GLSL Shaders
├─ 60 FPS with 30k particles (desktop)
├─ 30 FPS with 10k particles (mobile, adaptive)
├─ Custom particle physics with mouse interaction
├─ Real-time morphing between states
└─ Glassmorphism UI with WebGL cursor
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| What | Why |
|------|-----|
| React Three Fiber | Declarative 3D without fighting the framework |
| WebGL 2.0 + GLSL | Direct GPU access when you need raw performance |
| Vite | Fast builds, no webpack config headaches |
| GSAP | Smooth animations that don't jank |
| Zustand | State management without the ceremony |

## 🎯 How I Work

**Architecture**: Component-driven design for scale and maintainability
**Performance**: Hardware detection, adaptive rendering, sub-100ms loads
**Developer Experience**: Fast CI/CD, clear patterns, minimal config
**Mobile**: Progressive enhancement, not desktop-first afterthoughts

---

## 📊 Performance

- **30k particles @ 60 FPS** (desktop) | **10k @ 30 FPS** (mobile)
- **< 2s load time** on 3G
- **< 250kb gzipped** bundle (code-split)
- **95+ Lighthouse** score across all metrics
